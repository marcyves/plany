# Plany

Easy Project Planification for freelancers

This is a work in progress side project I planned to work on since a long time. The main goal is to replace a huge Excel table I am using for years in order to track my activity. If this can be useful to someone else, I would be more than happy and I hope to get help and ideas from the community.

As of December 2022 this is not even an alpha version, however I can list here the main points :

Plany will provide :

 * Manage different users
 * Each user can get their list of clients
 * Each client get a list of projects attached
 * Each project is planned accross days, or hours per day
 * An Agenda view can display which and when each project is involved
